# Rules Directory

This directory contains rules and guidelines for Cursor AI agents working on this project.

## Files

- **`cursor-rules.md`** - Comprehensive, detailed rules document covering all aspects of the project
- **`.cursorrules`** (in project root) - Concise rules file that Cursor reads automatically

## Usage

Cursor agents will automatically read `.cursorrules` from the project root. For more detailed information, refer to `cursor-rules.md`.

## Purpose

These rules help Cursor AI agents:
- Understand project structure and architecture
- Follow code style conventions
- Use correct patterns and best practices
- Maintain consistency across the codebase
- Avoid common mistakes

## Updating Rules

When adding new patterns or conventions to the project, update both files:
1. Add detailed explanation to `cursor-rules.md`
2. Add concise entry to `.cursorrules`
